# Art + Blockchain = Future
Together with the community, We explore the common ground between art and blockchain. And then we put it into practice.
## Blockchain makes the art market safer
Upon creation, ownership and trade history can be tracked on a publically verifiable ledger (blockchain). This helps combat issues like plagiarism and can be used to verify copyright of images.
## Blockchain expands the market
The market is becoming more accessible to more participants through opportunities such as fractional ownership, asset-backed lending, artist royalties.
## Ease of blockchain transactions
The absence of unnecessary costs and intermediaries in transactions (banks and galleries) is a must for the artist.
## Location doesn't matter
Exhibitions in the metaverse, the rejection of the expansion of galleries and the centralization of the market
## Through art, we explore the crypto ecosystem
The programme is designed to catalyse cooperation between disciplines and sectors, enabling participants to interrogate the benefits and pitfalls of blockchain developments for arts, culture and wider society.
## New art forms
the emergence of such new forms of art as programmable art. This attracts more new people and connects the technical and humanitarian side of knowledge in the blockchain.

Сrypto, blockchain and web3 technologies make it possible to change the art market – to make it independent, decentralized and free.
